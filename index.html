      Our system enables users to textually input or capture images of their meals, which are
      analyzed using a deep learning model trained specifically on Indian dishes and thalis. Each
      meal is mapped to nutrient data from the Indian Food Composition Tables, providing
      accurate estimates of calories and nutrient intake. Beyond daily tracking, SehatSutra uses
      predictive modeling to forecast future deficiencies and recommends balanced, region and
      season aware foods suited to dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, non-vegetarian).<br><br>
      An AI nutrition coach interacts conversationally, encouraging better habits using positive
      reinforcement and culturally relevant guidance.
      By combining computer vision, predictive analytics, reasoning AI, and behavioral modeling,
      SehatSutra goes beyond tracking, it understands, predicts, and guides in ways current AI
      systems cannot. The project aims to make nutrition awareness intelligent, empathetic, and
      deeply rooted in India's cultural food diversity, yet led by technology and Artificial
      Intelligence.
